                Information about owls
            </h1>

                The owl is a nocturnal bird of prey. The coloring depends on the place of her residence, 
                which disguises her as a terrain. The head of the bird is round with large eyes, the beak
                 is short and predatory, the claws are sharp and long. Owls come in different sizes 
                 depending on their species. The smallest owl is up to 20 cm, and the largest is 70 cm.
                 Birds have strong and sinewy paws with claws, with which they capture their prey. 
                 The eyes of owls are large, in the dark they see no worse than during the day, but owls 
                 practically do not notice anything near them. 
            </p>
            <p class="text1">
                Hearing in owls is 50 times better developed than in humans. 
                Their neck is very mobile, which makes it possible for them to rotate their heads 270 degrees.
